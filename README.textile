h2. jQuery highlightRegex plugin

Want to highlight some text on a page with information you only know in javascript, maybe based on some dynamic input?  Check out the "highlight v3":http://johannburkard.de/blog/programming/javascript/highlight-javascript-text-higlighting-jquery-plugin.html
 by "Johann Burkard":http://johannburkard.de/.  Need to be able to do the same thing but with a regular expression?  You're at the right place.

h3. Demonstration

Check out a simple demo "here.":http://www.jacobrothstein.com/highlightRegex/demonstration.html (source included in this repository).

h3. Usage

At this point, it's very simple:

@$('#any.jquery.selector').highlightRegex(/[aeiou]/ig);@

This would wrap all all vowels inside of #any.jquery.selector with a @<span class='highlight'>@.
  
To clear the highlighting, just call @$('#any.jquery.selector').highlightRegex();@ (with no argument).
